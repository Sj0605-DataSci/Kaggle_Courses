You will define these values in the code cell below.\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/FBoWr2f.png\" width=80%><br/>\n</center>\n    \n\nTo check your answer, we use your values to create a heuristic function as follows:\n\n```python\ndef get_heuristic_q1(grid, col, mark, config):\n    num_twos = count_windows(grid, 2, mark, config)\n    num_threes = count_windows(grid, 3, mark, config)\n    num_fours = count_windows(grid, 4, mark, config)\n    num_twos_opp = count_windows(grid, 2, mark%2+1, config)\n    num_threes_opp = count_windows(grid, 3, mark%2+1, config)\n    score = A*num_fours + B*num_threes + C*num_twos + D*num_twos_opp + E*num_threes_opp\n    return score\n```\n\nThis heuristic is then used to create an agent, that competes against the agent from the tutorial in 50 different game rounds.  In order to be marked correct, \n- your agent must win at least half of the games, and\n- `C` and `D` must both be nonzero.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# TODO: Assign your values here\nA = 1e10\nB = 1e4\nC = 1e2\nD = -1\nE = -1e6\n# Check your answer (this will take a few seconds to run!)\nq_1.check()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-03-29T22:45:50.217822Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-03-29T22:45:50.218276Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-03-29T22:46:05.524632Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-03-29T22:45:50.218239Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-03-29T22:46:05.523215Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":4,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Your Agent's Win Percentage (in 50 game rounds): 0.58\nTutorial Agent's Win Percentage (in 50 game rounds): 0.42\n","output_type":"stream"},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"<IPython.core.display.Javascript object>","application/javascript":"parent.postMessage({\"jupyterEvent\": \"custom.exercise_interaction\", \"data\": {\"outcomeType\": 1, \"valueTowardsCompletion\": 0.3333333333333333, \"interactionType\": 1, \"questionType\": 2, \"questionId\": \"1_BetterHeuristic\", \"learnToolsVersion\": \"0.3.4\", \"failureMessage\": \"\", \"exceptionClass\": \"\", \"trace\": \"\"}}, \"*\")"},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Correct","text/markdown":"<span style=\"color:#33cc33\">Correct</span>"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Lines below will give you a hint or solution code\n#q_1.hint()\n#q_1.solution()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-03-29T22:46:13.047840Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-03-29T22:46:13.048278Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-03-29T22:46:13.055106Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-03-29T22:46:13.048241Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-03-29T22:46:13.053361Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":5,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 2) Does the agent win?\n\nConsider the game board below.  \n\n<center>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/AlnaQ3J.png\" width=30%><br/>\n</center>\n\nSay the agent uses red discs, and it's the agent's turn.  \n- If the agent uses the heuristic **_from the tutorial_**, does it win or lose the game?\n- If the agent uses the heuristic **_that you just implemented_**, does it win or lose the game?","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#q_2.hint()","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Check your answer (Run this code cell to receive credit!)\nq_2.solution()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-03-29T22:46:21.034550Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-03-29T22:46:21.035069Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-03-29T22:46:21.047533Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-03-29T22:46:21.035029Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-03-29T22:46:21.045917Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":6,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"<IPython.core.display.Javascript object>","application/javascript":"parent.postMessage({\"jupyterEvent\": \"custom.exercise_interaction\", \"data\": {\"interactionType\": 3, \"questionType\": 4, \"questionId\": \"2_BothLose\", \"learnToolsVersion\": \"0.3.4\", \"valueTowardsCompletion\": 0.0, \"failureMessage\": \"\", \"exceptionClass\": \"\", \"trace\": \"\", \"outcomeType\": 4}}, \"*\")"},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Solution: The agent has two choices: it can play in either column 0 (the leftmost column), or column 6 (the rightmost column).
